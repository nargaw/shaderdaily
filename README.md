Hello!

Welcome to Shader Daily!

This is where all the shaders are placed in a single unified repository. 

The shaders are organized by number in the '/shaders' folder. The shaders are updated daily.

The shaders are free to use for non-commercial purposes such as learning and personal projects.

For commercial use of the shaders, please contact me at nateargaw@gmail.com.

Thank you!!

Nate Argaw
