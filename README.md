Hello!

Welcome to Shader Daily!

This is where all the shaders are placed in a single unified repository. 

The shaders are organized by number in the '/shaders' folder. The shaders are updated daily.

The shaders are free to use for non-commercial purposes such as learning and personal projects.

For commercial use of the shaders, some of the code references other people's work so please be mindful of their copyright designations or please feel free to contact me at nateargaw@gmail.com.

Thank you and Enjoy!!
